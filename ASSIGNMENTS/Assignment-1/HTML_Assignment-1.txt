1. What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design webpages. It structures web content through the use of elements represented by tags. These tags define various parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc. 

Example of a simple HTML structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of web development!</p>
  </body>
</html>


2. Are HTML Tags and Elements the Same Thing?
No, HTML tags and elements are not exactly the same.

- Tags are the building blocks enclosed in angled brackets like <p>, <h1>, and <a>. They define the start and (sometimes) the end of an HTML element.
- Elements consist of both the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag (if applicable). For example, <h1>Hello</h1> is an element where <h1> is the opening tag, Hello is the content, and </h1> is the closing tag.


3. What Are Tags and Attributes in HTML?
- Tags are used to mark up the beginning and end of an HTML element. Examples include <p>, <div>, <a>, etc. 
- Attributes are additional information about elements. They are written inside the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs, like class, id, href, src, etc.

Example with attributes:

<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>

Here, href and target are attributes of the <a> (anchor) tag, which help define the link destination and behavior.



4. What Are Void Elements in HTML?
Void elements are HTML elements that do not have any content and therefore do not need a closing tag. They are self-contained. Common examples include:

- <br> (line break)
- <img> (image)
- <hr> (horizontal rule)
- <input> (input field)

These elements are often used for standalone tasks. No closing tag is necessary for void elements. 

Example:

<img src="image.jpg" alt="A sample image">
<br>
<hr>



5. What Are the Features of HTML?
Some of the key features of HTML include:

- Platform-independent : HTML works across all devices and browsers.
- Easy to learn : HTML is simple, with straightforward syntax.
- Hyperlinks : Allows linking to other web pages.
- Multimedia support : Embed images, videos, and audio into your web pages.
- Extensible with other technologies : You can integrate HTML with CSS, JavaScript, etc.
- SEO-friendly : HTML allows you to optimize content for search engines.




6. Difference Between HTML vs XHTML
While HTML and XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) are quite similar, they have some distinct differences:

| Feature             | HTML                                   | XHTML                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Syntax              | More forgiving                         | Strict syntax rules                  |
| Tag Closing         | Optional in many cases                 | Mandatory for all elements (e.g., <br/>) |
| Case Sensitivity    | Tags are not case-sensitive (<p> = <P>)| Tags must be lowercase (<p>)         |
| Error Handling      | Browsers handle errors leniently       | Errors cause parsing to fail         |
| Document Type       | Uses <!DOCTYPE html>                   | Uses <!DOCTYPE xhtml>                |
